  ### Project Overview

The sales store based in Bali has a dataset which contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. This analysis aims to provide insights into the sales performance of the store since the inception of video games. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends and make insightful recommendations for better performance.

### Data Source
This data was provided by the data analysis instructor of the academy following the completion of data analysis with Excel training. [Dowload here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZZbMyam63KBjDOK_Mc25NxyJvOt8v0Mv5ZxPMvHRjxA)

### Tools
- Microsoft Excel

  ### Data Preparation

  In order to have an accurate analysis, we performed the following tasks:
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Finding and replacing null values
  3. Data cleaning and formatting
      
 
     ### Exploratory Data Analysis

     EDA involved exploring the data to determine key variables, such as:

     - Genre with the highest percentage of games
     - What year had the highest sales and suggest why it happened
     - Genre with the highest sales
    
         ### Data Analysis
 
     With the use of Pivot tables, Pivot Charts and Filter options, I was able to analyze the rate of sales according to the publishers and years in relation to each game sold. In addition I was able to determine the percentage of sales of each game belonging to different Genres on several platforms. I also used Conditional formatting to detrmine top highest sales.

     ### Summary of results
     
     At the conclusion of the analysis, I was able to evaluate the trend of sales of video games.
  - Action Games has the highest sales as it had 19.98% of the total sales.
  - The sales of video games have been steadily increasing from 1980 to 2008 which was the peak of sales but there was a quick decline from 2010 to 2020.
  - The Game and Publisher that had the highest sales were Wii Sports and Nintendo respectively.
 
    ### Recommendations
    Based on the conclusion of the analysis, I discovered that the decline in sales can be traced to the oversaturation of the entertainment industry. There have been more innovations over the years that have replaced the video games. However, the following are some recommendations I would love to give for better sales:
    1. Improved Marketing to increase visiblity through merchandise like shirts, bags, bottles etc inorder to reach and influence the target audience.
       - The Company can make use of sport stars and action movies stars to influence the target audience.
    2. Creation of new and trendy characters in the games.
    3. Availability of Video games for purchase.
       - Some games are not accessible on certain devices which has led to the decline in sales.
    4. Implement a customer feedback strategy to improve the game productions.
